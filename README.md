# Re-simulation-of-plasmonic-waveguide
The simulation files were provided to re-simulate the structures introduced in the paper entitled "Plasmonic materials for metal–insulator–semiconductor–insulator–metal nanoplasmonic waveguides on silicon-on-insulator platform".

This simulations were performed using the Ansys Lumerical FDTD software, version 2020. The name of each file indicates the concept of the device and the corresponding simulation.

To run the files, please follow these steps:

1. Open the .fsp format file.
2. Click on the "Run" button.
3. Wait for the simulation to finish.
4. Use the DFT Monitor named "Power-SiO2" to plot the transmitted power along the length of the device.
5. Use the DFT Monitor named "XY" to plot the electric (E) and magnetic (H) field distributions at a wavelength of 1550 nm.
